> Discord, redesigned in Windows 98 retro-style built for the Codedex Mini Holiday Hackathon 2024.

[**Live Demo**](https://yayretrocord.vercel.app/)

## üéÆ Overview

RetroCord reimagines Discord with a classic Windows 98 aesthetic. Experience the modern communication platform through the lens of 90s design, complete with classic UI elements, retro color schemes, and nostalgic interactions.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Authentic Windows 98 UI**: Experience 90s retro vibe with this one
- **Garbage Authentication**: Welp, what would you ask more from a static website? Enter username, get in.
- **Servers & Channels**: Organize conversations in different servers & channels just like our beloved discord.
- **Real-Time Chat**: Send and receive messages in a retro-styled interface. Real time? Or is it?
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices
- **Local Storage**: Persistent data storage using browser's local storage. Eh? Database is for noobs.
- **Retro Animations**: Classic Windows 98-style effects, transitions and animations.
- **Hit Counter**: Classic webpage hit counter for that authentic 90s feel. It scams though.
